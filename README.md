# GoCache - A Lightweight Distributed Caching System in Golang  

GoCache is a high-performance, in-memory caching system built in Go. It supports TTL-based expiration, automatic cleanup, and is designed to scale across multiple nodes using consistent hashing (coming soon ðŸš€).  

## âœ¨ Features  
âœ… Fast In-Memory Storage using Go maps & sync.RWMutex  
âœ… TTL (Time-to-Live) Expiration for automatic key removal  
âœ… Background Cleanup Routine to remove expired keys  
âœ… Thread-Safe Operations for concurrent access  
âœ… Designed for Distributed Scaling (Step 2: Multi-node support)  

## ðŸš€ Future Enhancements  
ðŸ”„ Multi-Node Scaling with Consistent Hashing  
ðŸ“Œ LRU/LFU Eviction Policies  
ðŸ“¦ Persistent Storage with BadgerDB  
ðŸ“œ Make it a Reusable Golang Library  
ðŸš€ Contributions & Feedback are Welcome!  

<!--## ðŸ”§ Installation & Usage  

Clone the repo and run: --> 

<!-- ```sh
go run main.go -->

<!-- ## ðŸš§ Work in Progress The following features are planned but not yet implemented: - Multi-node support - LRU/LFU eviction policies - Persistent storage - Library packaging Stay tuned for updates! ðŸš€ -->
